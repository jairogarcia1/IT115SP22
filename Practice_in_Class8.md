## To find out who made a change to your group's project use "git blame" (see example below) <br>

## to create a git patch file use "git diff" command and copy all changes to the patch file (see example below) <br>

## To update your local repository with the latest version of the group project code use the "git pull" command (see example below) <br>
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-26 at 8 48 12 PM" src="images/Assignment8/gitPull.png"><br><hr><br>

## The local repository is up to date so no changes are made.<br>
